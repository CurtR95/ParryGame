Primary focus is parry mechanic, secondary is an atypical adventure game.

When an enemy attacks a direction appears on screen, the player must meet that direction in time. More advanced attacks will have multiples of these.  
The targettng reticule is a parry device, jump/roll device and attack device.  
The player is incentivised to learn the enemies moveset.  
Whilst engaged a bar will appear on the top of the screen to indicate that an engagement has begun.   
During an engagement, there will be a bout, chosen from either situation and randomness.  
The bout will zoom to the player and the enemy so they can both be seen.  
A bout is made up of four stages:  
- Pre-bout: the screen will indicate what attacks are due, but this can be cancelled if an attack is attempted it can be blocked, prematurely ending a bound.
- Mid-bout: the attacks have begun, if these are dodged then the enemy can usually be attacked.
- End-bout: if the attacks have not been parried, the bout ends and the enemy enters a recovery stage. Typically enemies will block damage in this phase.
- Bout Won: If 66%+ of the attacks were parried successfully, then the enemy enters a staggered state, ALL enemies are vulnerable in this state.

Example enemies:
- Simple Enemy, engages in melee range only, simple four standard directions. Can only be attacked after winning a bout or mid bout.
- Range Enemy, engage in randged combat only, diagonal s only. Can be attacked anytime.
- Charger, will chase the player with a single directional, always the opposite direction they are charging in. If the player is in melee range already they will shove the player back with a harmless attack. Can be attacked from either behind, or by winning a bout.
- Mini Boss, String of commands shown from left to right. Can only be attacked after winning a bout or mid bout.
- Advanced Enemy, strings together one melee with push and one ranged. Can only be attacked after winning a bout or mid bout.
- Boss fight, uses all of the above mechanics. Can only be attacked after winning a bout or mid bout. Has full boss health bar.

MVP Play:  
Start with basics to guide player through simple controls and platforming. Teach wall jumping, etc.  
Throw a Simple enemy at the player and guide them through simple mechanics.  
Explain how the bout system works, show how bouts end if the player leaves line of sight for a duration of time.  
Show a pit and hint at the charger, show the charger starting a bout but falling in the pit.  
Put a checkpoint here.  
More environmental dangers, and a simple ranged enemy. Player has to jump towards them, they will back off slightly.  
Throw a simple and ranged at the same time.  
Show a charger, perhaps hint at other methods of attacking enemies who have weak spots.  
Put a checkpoint here.  
Melee Mini Boss to explore how stringing together attacks works.  
Throw a few simple situations with the above exploring what the player has learnt. One of these will be an advanced enemy.  
Put final checkpoint here.  
Boss fight here, perhaps add environmental effects for eagle eyed players that make charging dangerous for the boss.
